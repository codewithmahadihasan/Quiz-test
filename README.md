### Description :

##### Home: I basically created this site where there are a few courses and all of the courses have quizzes that you have to click on to get to a quiz section. If any question is correct, welcome will be given and if it is wrong, it will be said that there is a mistake. And if you want to know the correct answer, then you have to click on the symbol like an eye.

##### Static: Inside it there is a graph named static, when you go there it will be seen as a graph which will show how many quizzes there are in all categories.

##### Question: There is a place called Questions which contains answers to three questions which will be taken by clicking on 'Learn More' on Home or clicking on 'Questions'.

##### Eror : If someone searches through any other route, he will get an error message
